2.1	Agreement
This Agreement contains the general contractual terms and conditions applicable to the Services to be provided by Provider to Customer.

2.2.1	The Parties shall, from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, enter into individual SOWs to govern the specific Services to be performed by Provider under this Agreement and the terms hereof.
 
2.2.2	The JSC will determine the content of each SOW in accordance with the terms set forth in Schedules 4.2, 7.1 and 15.1. Each SOW shall be executed by an Authorized Representative of each of Customer and Provider. Each SOW shall, upon full execution thereof, be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and governed by the provisions hereof and the additional provisions set forth in such Statement of Work.
 
3.	TERM
 
3.1	Term of this Agreement
 
3.1.1	This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, for a period of seven (7) years (the “Initial Term”). Unless otherwise provided, the termination or expiration of a Statement of Work shall not automatically terminate this Agreement, but the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall automatically terminate all Statements of Work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with Section 26.18 below, any obligation undertaken hereunder by either Party that, by its nature or its terms, is intended to extend beyond the Term shall survive the termination hereof.
 
3.1.2	Should a Party wish to continue this Agreement after the Initial Term or the then existing Term, such Party shall give the other Party a request in writing to renew this Agreement no later than seven (7) months prior to the expiration of Initial Term or the then-existing Term, as the case may be. Upon receipt of such request
________________________________________
 	to extend the Term of the Agreement, the other Party shall have thirty (30) days in which to accept, in writing, such request for extension. A failure to accept such request within the specified period shall be deemed to be a rejection, in which case neither Party shall have any obligation to negotiate any type of extension of the Term of this Agreement. If the other Party accepts an extension request, the Parties will thereafter negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions that will apply during the extended term (each an “Extended Term”) with a goal of reaching mutual agreement at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then-existing Term.
 
3.2	Term of Statement of Work
Each SOW shall set forth the applicable term for the SOW (each, a “SOW Term”), which SOW Term shall continue for the Term of this Agreement unless the Parties mutually agree in writing otherwise, except that all SOWs, unless sooner terminated, shall terminate at the expiration or termination of the Term of this Agreement.
 
3.3	Termination For Convenience
Customer may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part as to any SOW or portion thereof, for convenience and without cause at any time by giving Provider at least * prior written notice designating the termination date (the “Termination for Convenience Effective Date”), in which event this Agreement or the relevant SOW (or portion thereof) shall terminate as if the date so specified were the originally scheduled date of termination. In the event that a purported termination for cause by Customer under Section 22.1 is determined by a competent authority not to be properly a termination for cause, then such termination by Customer shall be deemed to be a termination for convenience with adequate prior notice under this Section 3.3. In the event of a termination by Customer for convenience pursuant to this Section 3.3, then Customer shall pay to Provider a termination fee, for each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3, determined as follows (the “Termination for Convenience Fee”):
 
3.3.1	In the event that the Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place before the end of * set forth in each SOW or portion thereof so terminated under Section 3.3 for the Service(s) that are the subject of Customer’s termination for convenience notice (the “Terminated Services”) then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or has become obligated to pay to Provider for those Terminated Services under the Agreement for the * period immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date; provided, however, that if Customer has paid or become obligated to pay less than * of fees immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the aggregate amount of fees that Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for those Terminated Services as to each * for which fees were paid or became payable for the * after the relevant SS Commencement Date plus a projected amount based on the average * amount of the fees paid or payable for the * during the period when fees were in fact paid for
________________________________________
 	each additional * necessary to bring the total number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee is paid to *.
 
3.3.2	The number of * for which the Termination for Convenience Fee described in Section 3.3.1 above shall be payable shall decrease by * and on each successive * of the relevant SS Commencement Date after a Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place. For example, if a Customer-designated Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the applicable Termination for Convenience Effective Date, and, if the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place between the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date, then the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider for the Terminated Services under the Agreement during the * immediately preceding the Termination for Convenience Effective Date, with the * reductions to continue in a like manner, except that in no event shall the Termination for Convenience Fee be less than * fees paid or payable by Customer to Provider, irrespective of the Termination for Convenience Effective Date.
 
3.3.3	In the event of a De Facto Termination for Convenience (as such term is defined below) by Customer, Customer shall pay a Termination for Convenience Fee based on when the Termination for Convenience Effective Date takes place as provided in Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.2 above only for the average * shortfall of those Services or category of Services under a given SOW that are considered to have suffered a De Facto Termination for Convenience (i.e., the volume of Services terminated beyond the * threshold described below). For purposes of this Section 3.3.3, a “De Facto Termination for Convenience” means a sustained decrease over each of * following the SS Commencement Date in the volume of one or more Services under a given SOW for which Customer is obligated to pay (based on the number of transactions available for Provider to perform) that is greater than * of the * average of the same over the * immediately preceding the period of decreased volume. For example, if the * average volume of transactions during months * following the * of the relevant SS Commencement Date is * transactions and the volume of transactions that Customer makes available to Provider to perform during months * is *, respectively, then Customer shall be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience for exceeding the * variance threshold of * transactions (* % of *) for * and shall be obligated to pay Provider a Termination for Convenience Fee equal to * worth of fees associated with the average * shortfall of * transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Customer be deemed to have committed a De Facto Termination for Convenience if Provider is otherwise able to redeploy the Provider Personnel who would otherwise have been idled by the shortfall in volume of Services required to perform other Services on behalf of Customer. In addition, for purposes of clarification and to avoid any misunderstanding, any portion of a Service for which Customer is obligated to pay (even if such Service
________________________________________
 	is not utilized) shall not constitute a shortfall and applied in determining whether the * variance threshold has been exceeded or the amount of the Termination for Convenience Fee for a De Facto Termination for Convenience.
 
3.3.4	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.3, in the event that in any * during the Initial Term, Customer demands, and Provider meets such demand for, a Major Increase (as such Term is defined below) in Services, then the formula for determining the applicable Termination for Convenience Fee shall “reset” and revert to the amount specified in Section 3.3.1, as may be subsequently reduced by * fees for the Terminated Service each year thereafter as provided in Section 3.3.2. For purposes of this Section 3.3.4, a “Major Increase” means a sustained increase in the volume of a Service demanded by Customer after the relevant SS Commencement Date during each of * that is greater than * of the * average over the * immediately preceding the period of increased volume, which increase requires Provider to incur additional capital costs and/or enter into additional binding commitments in order to meet Customer’s demands that, in aggregate, exceed by more than * the pre-existing costs or commitments incurred by Provider immediately prior to Customer’s demand for such Major Increase.
 
4.	SERVICES
 
4.1	Provision of Services
Provider will provide to Customer, and Customer will receive from Provider, the Services specified in this Agreement and the Statements of Work.
 
4.2	Implementation and Commencement of Services
The Services will be implemented and will commence in accordance with the terms set forth on Schedule 4.2 attached hereto and the applicable SOW.
 
4.3	Implied Services
If any services, functions or responsibilities not specifically described in this Agreement are required for the proper performance and provision of the Services, they shall be deemed to be implied by and included within the scope of the Services to the same extent and in the same manner as if specifically described in this Agreement; provided, however, if such Implied Services will cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, then Provider shall be entitled to submit a written request to the JSC and/or the Governance Board for Customer to provide additional compensation to Provider for such additional costs. Failure by Provider to submit such written request prior to its incurring such additional costs shall constitute a waiver by Provider of its right to seek additional compensation therefor. If the JSC and the Governance Board fail to agree on the resolution of such request, then it may be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement.
 
4.4	Resources Generally
________________________________________
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Provider shall be responsible for providing all of the resources necessary to provide the Services, including, without limitation, facilities, personnel, software and equipment. In this regard, Provider shall maintain the Equipment and Software used to provide the Services, including (a) maintaining Equipment in good operating condition; (b) undertaking repairs and preventive maintenance on Equipment in accordance with the applicable Equipment manufacturer’s recommendations; and (c) performing Software maintenance, other than with respect to Customer Software maintained by Customer, in accordance with the applicable Software vendor’s documentation and recommendations. Further, Provider agrees to maintain the compatibility of the Equipment, Provider Software, Licensed Software, and other technologies used by Provider in performing the Services (and for which Provider is responsible) with those used by Customer in order for Provider to provide, and Customer to utilize, the Services.
 
4.5	Changes
 
4.5.1	Either Party may request a change in or addition to the scope, processes, service levels, service recipients, implementation plan or other changes to a SOW (each, a “Change”), but except as provided in Section 4.5.3, no Change shall be effective and binding unless such Change has been documented in a written change of control document and signed by an Authorized Representative of each Party (each, a “Change Order”). Each Change Order shall be substantially in the form contained in Schedule 4.5 hereto, depending on the nature of the Change. If either Party desires to propose a Change, such Party shall deliver to the relevant Account Manager of the other Party a change request in writing, describing the Change(s) proposed. The Party receiving the request shall respond within ten (10) days following its receipt thereof. If the receiving Party is amenable to the change request, it shall notify the requesting Party, and the requesting Party shall submit a Change Order in draft form for the consideration and approval of the other Party. A Change Order shall include, among other items as appropriate, an estimate of additional or reduced charges to Customer, if applicable, any additional equipment or software or other material required to implement the Change and any expected impact on the project schedule or service-levels under the applicable SOW. Upon execution, including signature by an Authorized Representative of each Party, the Change Order shall become effective and the applicable SOW shall be deemed to have been amended by the Change Order. If the Parties are unable to agree on a Change, then the issue may be referred by the requesting Party to the JSC for resolution.
 
4.5.2	Without limiting the generality of Section 4.5.1 above, the Change Order procedures provided in Section 4.5.1 shall also apply to (i) any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any Administrative Manual practice or procedure that does not qualify as a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure, (ii) any acknowledgement of the achievement of a SOW milestone event (e.g. the RU Commencement Date and the SS Commencement Date) and (iii) any acknowledgement of the occurrence of an operational event that results in the assessment of a SLA Credit or SLA Bonus, as the case may be, or relieves
________________________________________
 	either Party of its obligations hereunder such as a Relief Event for a Force Majeure Event.
 
4.5.3	Any changes to the legal, regulatory or Payor contract requirements that Provider is required to meet pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be dependent on the execution and approval of a Change Order and shall be effective upon the date of receipt by Provider of written notice thereof signed by an Authorized Representative of Customer, unless such written notice provides for a later effective date; provided that such changes shall still be reviewed and memorialized by the JSC in accordance with the Change Order procedures set forth in Section 4.5.1 above.
 
4.5.4	Any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any term of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms set forth in Section 26.15 below.
 
4.5.5	Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above, the Parties’ designated Account Managers may jointly recommend approval of modifications, amendments or alterations to Minor Administrative Manual Practices or Procedures, which recommendations, if adopted, will take immediate effect; provided, however, that such modifications, amendments or alterations cannot and shall not amend or waive any provision of this Agreement or any portion hereof and the effectiveness of such modifications, amendments or alterations may be suspended or nullified by the JSC at any time. For purposes of this Section 4.5, a “Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure” change shall mean a change that does not (i) significantly alter the existing work flow currently in process (i.e. the change does not have any impact on the productivity and average handling time of the process), (ii) alter existing technology currently deployed for the process, and (iii) have any impact on the number of resources (agents and/ or supervisors) required to run the process after the change—including additional resources that may be required to manage any associated regulatory or compliance related requirements that may be a result of such change. In addition, for the sake of clarity, operationally, a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure change should result in simple dissemination of information to Provider Personnel by either the supervisors and/ or trainers on the process floor, and should not require more than one (1) hour of additional training of such Provider Personnel.
 
4.5.6	For the avoidance of doubt, as noted in Section 4.5.2 above, any requested modification, amendment or alteration to any Administrative Manual practice or procedure other than as specified in Section 4.5.3 that does not qualify as a Minor Administrative Manual Practice or Procedure shall be required to follow the Change Order procedures set forth in this Section 4.5 and memorialized using the Change Order forms set out in Schedule 4.5 hereto.

________________________________________
 	under circumstances similar to those under which services similar to the Services were being provided immediately prior to the Effective Date (collectively “Service Recipients”); provided, however, that any Services provided to Customer’s Affiliates or entities designated by Customer shall be pursuant to a separate SOW that takes into account the additional costs, if any, associated with the provision of the Services to such third parties.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Customer may utilize the Services in support of or as part of Customer’s business operations and offerings, provided that if Customer requires use of the Services in connection with entities that are not Service Recipients and not Customer Affiliates and as a result Provider would incur additional costs to a third party (e.g., additional third party license fees) in an amount representing a Significant Cost Increase, then there will be an equitable adjustment to the charges to accommodate such costs as herein provided.
 
4.6.2	If Customer Directs Provider to provide the Services to an entity pursuant to Section 4.6.1(ii) above and such entity is a Competitor, then Customer shall be deemed to have waived Provider’s compliance with the non-competition obligations under Section 25 below solely with respect to the acquired business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a purchaser of all or substantially all the assets of any line of business of Customer or its Affiliates seeks to novate the applicable SOW, then Provider will negotiate such novation in good faith.
 
4.6.3	For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the Services provided to the entities referenced in this Section 4.6 shall be deemed to be Services provided to Customer and (ii) all references to “Customer” with respect to receipt of the Services shall be deemed to include the entities referenced in this Section 4.6.

5.1.4	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1.3 above, Customer shall not be entitled to impose any amendment to this Agreement, policy or procedure which (i) would cause Provider to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, or insurance requirement, any agreement entered into in good faith with a third party on an arm’s length basis for purposes not relating to the evasion of this Agreement, or any order of a court or other judicial body to which Provider is or may become subject, or (ii) would unreasonably interfere with Provider’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder. In addition, if any such action on Customer’s part is not provided for in this Agreement or in any applicable SOWs in effect immediately prior to such action, and such action would cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, then Provider shall be entitled to request the JSC and/or the Governance Board to determine whether Provider is entitled to any additional compensation for its additional costs.

6.1	Relief Event
Customer acknowledges and agrees that there may be instances in which Provider will be unable to perform the Services without assistance from Customer. Consequently, Customer will provide to Provider, in a timely manner, such resources specified in each SOW, to enable Provider to perform the Services. Examples of such resources may include connectivity support, documentation, knowledge base, hardware, software, support personnel and trainers. Failure of Customer to provide any such assistance or resources specified in the applicable SOW will not constitute a breach by Customer or Customer Default but will merely be a Relief Event to the extent, and only for so long as, such failure persists and actually causes Provider to be unable or impairs Provider’s ability to provide the affected Services. Provider shall be obligated to perform any Services which are unaffected by such failure on the part of Customer, and Provider shall continue to provide even affected Services to the maximum extent that it is feasible to do so. Any resources not specifically identified in a SOW as Customer’s responsibility to obtain or provide shall be deemed to be Provider’s responsibility.

________________________________________
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Provider is relying on the accuracy of the written information and Directions supplied by Customer, and other requirements specified by Customer in writing (cumulatively, the “Processing Norms”), to perform the Services. In the event the Processing Norms are not accurate or are found to be inadequate, the Party discovering such fact shall promptly notify the other Party of any such deficiency and the Parties shall cooperate with each other to remedy the situation in a timely manner. So long as Provider is not otherwise aware of or does not have any reason to believe the Processing Norms supplied by Customer are inaccurate or inadequate or, if Provider is aware of or has reason to believe the Processing Norms supplied by Customer are inaccurate or inadequate, notifies Customer in writing of such fact, Provider shall (i) be entitled to rely on and act in accordance with the Processing Norms, (ii) not incur any liability for claims, losses or damages that arise as a result of Provider’s compliance with the Processing Norms and (iii) be entitled to payment for its performance, and be excused from its poor performance or non-performance of, the Services, to the extent Provider’s performance is predominantly affected by such inaccurate Processing Norms supplied by Customer.

20.1	Liability Cap

Provider and Customer further acknowledge and agree that they are entering in to this Agreement on the understanding that the fees for the Services to be provided under this Agreement have been set to reflect the fact that the liability and remedies shall be limited as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that any damages resulting from a Party’s failure to fulfill its obligations in accordance with this Agreement in the form of fines, penalties refund obligations and other financial costs levied or imposed on Customer as a result of Provider’s failure to perform the Services in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement shall be considered direct damages and shall not be considered consequential damages.
 
21.	FORCE MAJEURE
 
21.1	Force Majeure Events
Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, no Party shall be liable for any default or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement (i) if and to the extent such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by acts of terrorism, fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, riots, civil disorders, or any other such similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party, and (ii) provided the non-performing Party is without fault in causing such default or delay, and such default or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions and could not reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means (including with respect to Provider, by Provider meeting its obligations for performing disaster recovery services as described in this Agreement). Any such event or occurrence as described in this Section 21.1 shall be deemed a “Force Majeure Event.”
 
21.2	Excused Performance
Upon notification to the other Party of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the non-performing Party, except to the extent provided in this Agreement, shall be excused from further performance or observance of the obligations so affected for as long as such circumstances prevail and such Party continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to recommence performance or observance without delay. Any Party so delayed in its performance shall immediately notify the Party to whom performance is due by telephone (to be confirmed in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of the inception of such delay) and describe at a reasonable level of detail the circumstances causing such delay.
 
21.3	Force Majeure Remedies
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Provider agrees that no Force Majeure Event that affects Provider’s performance hereunder shall relieve Provider from its obligations for a period of more than three (3) days from the date on which Provider notifies or should have notified Customer of a Force Majeure Event. After the elapse of such period, all SLAs and other covenants applicable to Provider’s performance under this Agreement or any SOW shall again be in full force and effect. In addition, if any Force Majeure Event substantially prevents, hinders or
________________________________________
delays Provider’s performance of the Services such that it substantially interferes with Customer’s business for more than twenty four (24) hours, then Provider shall immediately shift its provision of the Services from the affected Facility to a Disaster Recovery Site described in Section 8 above (if Provider has not done so already). If the Force Majeure Event continues for more than three (3) consecutive days and Provider’s performance falls below the Catastrophic Failure Service threshold with respect to a Service, which for this purpose shall be no lower than 80% of the baseline Service Level specified in an applicable SOW (as supplemented by the SSIO thereto) with respect to any Service, then Customer may, at its option and without violation of the volume obligations under such SOW, procure such Service from an alternate source, and Provider shall be liable for payment for such Service from the alternate source, less any amounts that Customer did not pay to Provider as the result of Services not being rendered, for the lesser of (i) the period of time in which Provider’s performance remains so impaired, and (ii) thirty (30) days. Finally, effective beginning seven (7) days after Provider’s notification of the Force Majeure Event, in the event Provider’s performance remains below the Catastrophic Failure Service threshold with respect to a Service, which for this purpose shall be no lower than 80% of the baseline Service Level specified in an applicable SOW (as supplemented by the SSIO thereto) with respect to any Service, Customer may (x) terminate any portion of this Agreement so affected in whole or in part without penalty or fee, and the charges payable hereunder shall be equitably adjusted to reflect those terminated Services; or (y) terminate this Agreement in whole without liability to Provider, as of a date specified by Customer in a written notice of termination to Provider. Subject to the preceding sentence, Provider shall not have the right to any additional payments from Customer for costs or expenses incurred by Provider as a result of any Force Majeure Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree the foregoing rights of Customer shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to Customer hereunder or under law or equity.
 
21.4	Conditions on Provider’s Response
In addition to Customer’s rights set forth in this Section 21, the following conditions shall apply to Provider’s response to a Force Majeure Event:
 
21.4.1	Whenever a Force Majeure Event causes Provider to allocate limited resources between or among Provider’s customers, Provider shall allocate such resources in an equitable manner and shall not disadvantage Customer with respect to such allocation; and
 
21.4.2	In no event shall Provider re-deploy or reassign any Key Provider Personnel filling Key Provider Positions on the Customer account to another Provider customer, in the event of a Force Majeure Event.
 
22.	TERMINATION
 
22.1	Termination Due to Breach
 
22.1.1	Termination by Customer. Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement or any SOW, in whole or in part, or exercise the interim remedy described in Section 22.3 below by giving the specified written notice to Provider
________________________________________
 	and without further obligation or liability on the part of Customer, upon the occurrence of any of the following events of default (each, a “Provider Default”):
 
22.1.1.1	Upon ten (10) days notice if Provider commits a Provider Performance Default (as such term is defined in Section 22.2 below);
 
22.1.1.2	immediately upon notice if Provider violates (i) its non-compete obligations set forth in Section 25 below, (ii) any of its obligations relating to Customer Confidential Information or Customer Data, (iii) its compliance with applicable laws obligations relating to anti-corruption (Section 9.5), Restricted or Excluded Parties (Sections 10.2 and 17.3.7) or OFAC’s economic sanctions regulations (Section 9.6); or
 
22.1.1.3	upon thirty (30) days notice (or immediately if the material breach cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) days) if Provider commits a material breach of any other provision of this Agreement.
 
22.1.2	Termination by Provider. Provider shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Customer in the event that Customer fails to pay Provider when due charges totaling at least three (3) months’ charges under any SOW (excluding (i) amounts set off pursuant to Section 15.7, and (ii) disputed payments withheld pursuant to Section 15.5) and Customer fails to remedy the delinquency within thirty (30) Business Days of its receipt of such written notice (a “Customer Default”).
 
22.2	Termination Due to Failure to Meet Performance Standards
Provider shall be deemed to have committed a “Provider Performance Default” if:
 
22.2.1.1	Provider is liable to pay Major SLA Credits (as such term is defined in each SOW) under any SOW in any three (3) consecutive months or in any five (5) months within a rolling twelve (12) consecutive month period; or
 
22.2.1.2	A Catastrophic Failure (as such term is defined in each SOW) occurs.
 
22.3	Deferral and Assumption of Control Options
 
22.3.1	Upon the occurrence of a Provider Default, Customer may, at its sole option, defer its exercise of its termination rights under Section 22.1 above to dispatch Customer personnel to enter Provider’s facilities used to provide the Services and assist Provider with specific advice and instructions on how to improve its operations in performing the Services for up to * from the date Provider receives notice of a Provider Default (the “Deferral Period”). Provider shall cooperate fully with such assistance by Customer and implement any such Customer advice and instructions promptly.
 
22.3.2	If, at any time within the Deferral Period, Customer determines in its sole discretion that such limited assistance by Customer is insufficient to prevent a
________________________________________
 	recurrence of a Provider Default, Customer may, by giving written notice to Provider, discontinue the foregoing deferral of its exercise of termination rights and terminate this Agreement or any SOW, in whole or in part, and assume operational control over all of Provider’s facilities used to provide the Services, the Provider Property, the Equipment, the Provider Software and the Provider Personnel for up to * from the date of such notice (the “Controlled Migration Period”) for purposes of ensuring the proper performance of the Services and facilitating a smooth migration of the Services back to Customer or to Customer’s designee. During such Controlled Migration Period, Customer shall have the full authority previously held by Provider to manage the operations and supervise the Provider Personnel used to provide the Services. Provider shall cooperate fully with, and take all necessary steps to effect, such assumption of control by Customer, the continued performance of the Services and the migration of the Services back to Customer or to Customer’s designee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on Customer’s behalf and as Directed by Customer, Provider shall enforce all subcontracts and other third party contracts used in providing the Services or shall appoint Customer as Provider’s agent for the purpose of enforcing such contracts during the Controlled Migration Period.
 
22.4	Charges Upon Partial Termination
In the event of any termination in part by Customer, as provided in this Agreement, the charges payable under this Agreement for Services will be equitably adjusted to reflect those Services that are terminated. Upon termination of any or all Services under any SOW or this Agreement, Provider will be owed payment for Services completed up until the date of termination notice expiration, subject to any set-offs in accordance with Section 15.7 above.
 
22.5	Termination For Insolvency
Customer shall have the option, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement in its entirety (including all SOWs) if Provider: (a) becomes insolvent or is unable to meet its debts or obligations; (b) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy; (c) has an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it that is not challenged within fifteen (15) days and dismissed within thirty (30) days; (d) is adjudicated a bankrupt; (e) has a receiver or trustee appointed for its assets; (f) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (g) has any significant portion of its assets attached.
 
22.6	Termination due to Change of Control
If Provider (or its ultimate parent entity) is subject to a “Change of Control” (as such term is defined below), Provider shall notify Customer thereof no later than ten (10) days after the Change of Control takes place.
 
22.6.1	Following the first such notice of a Change of Control, if (a) immediately prior to the Change of Control, the Parties were no longer under the common control of the same parent company, and (b) following the Change of Control, Provider is materially less financially sound, has materially less resources, willingness or
________________________________________
 	capability to provide the Services, or is controlled by a Competitor, then for a period of * from the date of notice, Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon * written notice but without liability (except as otherwise provided herein) to Provider, unless Customer received notice of the proposed Change of Control at least * prior to its consummation and consented in writing thereto within * of its receipt thereof. In the event Provider provides such prior notice of a proposed Change of Control to Customer, Customer may grant, withhold or condition its consent in its sole and absolute discretion within said * period. Provider prefers that Customer communicate its decision in writing to Provider and Customer shall attempt in good faith to accommodate such preference, but failure by Customer to provide its written consent within said * period shall be deemed to be a decision by Customer to withhold its consent.
 
22.6.2	In the event that Provider provides a second or subsequent notice of a Change of Control, then Customer shall have all termination and consent rights as provided in Section 22.6.1, regardless of Provider’s financial health, resources, willingness or capability or any other criteria.
 
22.6.3	For purposes of this section, “Change of Control” means any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization or sale or transfer of equity securities of Provider (or its ultimate parent entity), in each case in which any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), other than Provider or an Affiliate, acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding or fully diluted voting securities of Provider or its ultimate parent entity or the right to appoint the majority of the board of directors of either Provider or its ultimate parent.
 
22.7	Termination Due to Material Adverse Regulatory Change
 
22.7.1	Provider shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, in whole but not in part, by giving at least four (4) months’ prior written notice to Customer in the event of a change in the U.S. tax or regulatory environment applicable to Provider and the offshore outsourcing industry generally, which change has a material adverse effect on Provider’s ability or cost to provide the Services. In the event Provider terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 22.7, Provider shall pay to Customer a termination fee equal to the amount of fees Customer paid to Provider under the Agreement for the six (6) full calendar months period immediately preceding the termination; provided, however, that if Customer has paid less than six (6) months of fees immediately preceding the termination, then the termination fee shall be equal to the aggregate amount of fees that Customer paid or became obligated to pay to Provider as to each month for which fees were paid or became payable for the first six (6) months plus a projected amount based on the average monthly amount of the fees paid or payable for the months during the period when fees were in fact paid for each additional month necessary to bring the total number of months for which the termination fee is paid to six (6).
________________________________________
22.7.2	The number of months for which the termination fee described in Section 22.7.1 above shall be payable shall decrease by one month on the first anniversary and on each successive anniversary of the Agreement after a termination takes place. For example, if the Provider termination takes place between the first and the second anniversary of the Term of the Agreement, then the termination fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid to Provider under the Agreement during the five (5) full calendar months immediately preceding the applicable termination by Provider under Section 22.7, and, if the termination by Provider takes place between the second and the third anniversary of the Term of the Agreement, then the termination fee shall be equal to the amount of fees Customer paid to Provider for under the Agreement during the four (4) full calendar months immediately preceding the termination by Provider, with the annual reductions to continue in a like manner, except that in no event shall the termination fee be less than one month’s fees paid or payable by Customer to Provider, irrespective of the date of termination by Provider.
 
22.8	Savings Clause
Due to the impact any termination of this Agreement would have on Customer’s business, Customer’s failure to perform its responsibilities set forth in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be grounds for termination by Provider. Provider acknowledges that Customer would not be willing to enter into this Agreement without assurance that it may not be terminated by Provider and that Provider may not suspend performance except, and only to the extent, pursuant to Section 15.5 or Section 22.1.2. Provider’s nonperformance of its obligations under this Agreement shall be excused if and to the extent (a) such Provider nonperformance results directly from a Relief Event comprised of Customer’s failure to perform its responsibilities; and (b) Provider provides Customer with reasonable notice of such nonperformance and (if requested by Customer) uses commercially reasonable efforts to perform, notwithstanding Customer’s failure (with Customer reimbursing Provider for its out-of-pocket expenses for such efforts).
 
22.9	Relief Events
 
22.9.1	In addition to any other provisions in this context that may be contained in this Agreement (and without in any way prejudicing or limiting them), Provider will not be in breach of this Agreement or the applicable SOW or liable for SLA Credits to the extent its failure to perform an obligation under this Agreement or the applicable SOW is solely a direct result of a Relief Event, subject to Provider:
 
22.9.1.1	providing Customer as soon as reasonably practicable with notice of the Relief Event where the Provider is aware or should reasonably have been aware of such Relief Event;
 
22.9.1.2	using all reasonable endeavours to perform the Services, notwithstanding the Relief Event; and
 
22.9.1.3	cooperating with and assisting Customer to correct Customer’s failure that gave rise to the Relief Event.
________________________________________
22.9.2	Provider shall not be entitled to rely on a Relief Event to avoid liability for breach of this Agreement, including payment of SLA Credits, if it fails to satisfy any of the conditions set out in Sections 22.9.1.1 to 22.9.1.3 above.
 
22.9.3	If Provider incurs a Significant Cost Increase to perform the Services pursuant to any SOW as a sole and direct result of any Relief Event, it shall be entitled to recover such additional direct costs from Customer, provided that Provider must obtain Customer’s prior written consent before incurring costs in excess of $500 per month or such other sum as may be specified in the applicable SOW.
 
22.9.4	Provided that Provider has complied with the provisions of Sections 22.9.1 and 22.9.2, Provider shall be entitled to an extension of the schedule for completion of the Services under the relevant SOW, and the period of the extension shall be at least equal to the reasonable delay caused solely and directly by such Relief Event.
 
22.9.5	The provisions of this Section 22.9 are Provider’s exclusive remedy for any Relief Event.
 
23.	EFFECTS OF TERMINATION
 
23.1	Wind-Up Events

In the event of any partial termination, the provision of Termination/Expiration Assistance shall be provided by Provider only as applicable to the Services terminated. The Termination/Expiration Assistance shall include but not be limited to the assistance described in Schedule 23.2.1 hereto.
________________________________________
23.2.2	Provision of Services After Termination/Expiration Date. In addition to the Termination/Expiration Assistance set forth in the preceding paragraph:
 
23.2.2.1	Upon expiration of the Term of this Agreement, for up to a period of * thereafter, Provider shall continue to provide, at Customer’s written request made at least * prior to such expiration, any or all of the Services being performed by Provider prior to such expiration date, including the Termination/Expiration Assistance.

23.2.2.5	In the event that Provider terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section (Material Adverse Regulatory Change), then for up to a period of * following the effective date of termination of this Agreement, Provider shall continue to provide, at Customer’s request, any or all of the Services being performed by Provider prior to such effective date, including the Termination/Expiration Assistance; provided, however, that, upon the execution of an appropriate Change Order, Provider may provide such Services from any of its offices located worldwide, which Change Order shall also specify the allocation of any additional costs that may be incurred by Provider in providing such Services from such other location.
 
23.2.3	To the extent Provider is to perform Services pursuant to Section 23.2.2 which were being performed prior to the termination/expiration date of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall be applicable as such provisions would
________________________________________
 	have been applicable to the Services prior to the effective date of termination. The charges for such activities that are provided without cessation by Provider after termination of the Agreement shall be: (i) for those Services for which there is a charge in the Agreement, such charges as were in effect immediately prior to the termination date, and (ii) for those Services for which there is no charge in the Agreement, at such rates as may be considered equitable by the JSC under the circumstances.
 
23.2.4	Cooperation. In the process of evaluating whether to allow the expiration, termination or renewal of this Agreement, Customer may consider obtaining, or determine to obtain, offers for performance of services similar to the Services prior to or following the termination/expiration of this Agreement. As and when reasonably requested by Customer for use in such a process, Provider shall provide to Customer such information and other cooperation regarding performance of the Services as would be reasonably necessary for a third party to prepare an informed, non-qualified offer for such services. Provider’s support in this respect shall include providing information regarding Equipment, Software, staffing and other matters as are necessary for the preparation of any such offer. Such cooperation shall include, including upon any termination in whole or in part, providing Customer and its designee (including third party vendors who shall transition the Services from Provider): (i) descriptions of hardware, software and services configurations, and (ii) reasonable access to Provider facilities utilized to provide the Services, provided however that Provider shall not be required to house any such third party personnel at such Provider facilities and subject to Provider’s generally applicable confidentiality and security requirements.

23.3	Post Termination Rights and Obligations
Termination of this Agreement or any SOW hereunder (howsoever occasioned) shall not affect the any accrued rights or liabilities of either Party nor shall it affect the coming in to force or the continuance in force of any position hereof which is expressly or by implication intended to come into or continue in force on or after such termination.

24.3.2	The arbitral panel shall consist of one arbitrator (where the amount in dispute is not more than US$ *), and three arbitrators (where the amount is more than US$ *). If there is to be only one arbitrator, that person will be selected in accordance with the AAA procedures referred to above. If there are to be three arbitrators, they will be selected as follows: each Party shall appoint one arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the notice of arbitration is received, and within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of both such Party-appointed arbitrators, such two arbitrators shall discuss and select a chairman. If the two Party-appointed arbitrators are unable to agree on the chairman within such period, then the chairman shall be selected in accordance with the applicable rules of the AAA. Each arbitrator shall be independent of each of the Parties. The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to conclude the arbitration within three (3) months after all three arbitrators have been appointed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that an arbitration is initiated for any Dispute and results in an arbitral award that is valued at less than $*, then the Party that initiated such arbitration shall be responsible for paying both Parties’ arbitration costs (including all administrative and arbiter fees as well as the
________________________________________
 	expenses of witnesses, counsel and other experts of both Parties), regardless of which Party ultimately prevailed in such Dispute.
 
24.3.5	The award or decision of the arbitrators shall be in writing, shall set forth the basis for such award and shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Judgment upon the award or decision may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of the award and/or an order of enforcement, as the case may be.
 
24.3.6	Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed as preventing any Party from seeking preliminary injunctive relief, temporary equitable relief or any other provisional remedy in aid of arbitration from any court of competent jurisdiction.

24.4	Continued Performance
Each Party agrees to continue performing its obligations under this Agreement while a Dispute is being resolved, except to the extent the issue in dispute precludes performance (it being agreed that a Dispute over payment shall not be deemed to preclude performance) and without limiting either Party’s right to terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 22.

Schedule 4.2
Migration / Implementation
Unless otherwise agreed to between the Parties, the following process shall be utilized by the Parties for purposes of (i) identifying the scope of Services to be provided under each SOW, each task to be included in the Services and the practices, policies and procedures to be adhered to in providing such Services, (ii) establishing the baseline levels of staffing to be utilized in providing such Services based on the historical volumes and productivity over at least a six-month period prior to the Ramp Up Period as processed by Customer or, if such historical data is unavailable, the actual volume of transactions and the actual productivity of the Provider Personnel during the Ramp Up Period, (iii) establishing the method and level of compensation to be paid to Provider in connection with such Services, (iv) establishing Performance Standards and Service Levels applicable to such Services, and (v) establishing thresholds for the different levels of Service Failures (Minor, Major and Catastrophic) and Service Excellence (Minor and Major) and the values of SLA Credits and SLA Bonuses, respectively, associated with each.
 
1.	Pre-Services Migration Plan. Prior to the execution of each SOW, the JSC shall prepare and the Governance Board shall approve a plan for the migration of the Services covered by the SOW from Customer’s work force to Provider’s work force (the “Pre-Services Migration Plan”). The Pre-Services Migration Plan will include the following elements unless the JSC and Governance Board determine otherwise:
 
 	(a)	Planning Period. During this initial period (the “Planning Period”), the JSC, Governance Board and other representatives of the Parties, as appropriate, will discuss in concept the Services which will be the subject of the SOW. If such representatives of the Parties concur that the Services under discussion are appropriate for outsourcing to Provider, Customer will provide Provider with the following:
 
 	•	 	A written description of the Services in question and a description of how the Services are currently being performed by Customer;
 
 	•	 	Customer’s policies and procedures and standard operating practices relating to the Services in question;
 
 	•	 	The anticipated volume of transactions comprising the Services in question;
 
 	•	 	Estimates of how long it takes to complete each such transaction as currently performed by Customer personnel;
 
 	•	 	The number of Customer employees currently devoted to the performance of such Services; and
 
2
________________________________________
 	•	 	To the extent such data exists and is readily available, details regarding the Customer’s baseline data for the previous six months.
Based upon the foregoing information, Provider will prepare and submit to the JSC for approval a draft SOW that will include, among other things, a proposed staffing plan specifying the number of FTEs required to provide the Service (which, in any event, shall be no greater than ninety percent (90%) of the number of full-time Customer employees currently devoted to the performance of the same Service) and the Provider Personnel who will occupy the Key Provider Positions as well as the proposed RU Rates for the Ramp Up Period pertaining to each proposed Service. If the JSC and Governance Board approve the draft SOW, the Parties will then memorialize their understanding in a finalized SOW. Unless otherwise specified in the SOW, the SOW shall be effective upon execution by an Authorized Representative of each Party (the “SOW Effective Date”)
In the event that Customer is unable to provide the baseline data for the previous six months, then Provider, if requested by Customer, or Customer will perform a base-lining exercise for validation of the SLA targets during the Ramp Up Period and thereafter submit to the JSC for approval a proposed Steady State Implementation Order for such SOW that includes, at a minimum, the proposed SS Rates and SLA terms for the Steady State Period pertaining to each proposed Service. If the JSC and Governance Board approve the SSIO, the Parties will then memorialize their understanding in accordance with the Change Order procedures described in Section 4.5 of the main text of the Agreement.
 
 	(b)	Other Pre-Services Migration Plan Provisions. The Pre-Services Migration Plan shall also include:
 
 	(i)	a description of the Services being migrated;
 
 	(ii)	a description of the methods and procedures, personnel (including skill sets and allocation) and organization Provider will use to perform the Migration;
 
 	(iii)	a training methodology plan to manage the transfer of knowledge from Customer to Provider Personnel, which plan may include travel by such Personnel to Customer facilities or Customer personnel traveling to Provider facilities, or both;
 
 	(iv)	a schedule of Migration activities, including a project plan from beginning until production cutover, including milestones, risks and risk management plans;
 
 	(v)	Provider Personnel information, such as years worked and years with business process outsourcing experience and other relevant qualifications, for the key Provider Personnel as reasonably specified by Customer;
 
 	(vi)	a detailed description of the respective roles and responsibilities of Customer and Provider; and
 
3
________________________________________
 	(vii)	such other information and planning as are necessary to ensure that the Migration takes place on schedule and without unplanned disruption to Customer operations.
 
 	(c)	Provider shall be responsible for revising and finalizing the base project plan under the Pre-Services Migration Plan in consultation with Customer Account Manager or the JSC, provided that: (i) Provider shall cooperate and work closely with Customer in making changes to the Pre-Services Migration Plan, if so requested by Customer; and (ii) any changes to the Pre-Services Migration Plan and subsequent versions of the Pre-Services Migration Plan shall be subject to mutual written agreement by the Parties and any such changes shall be made pursuant to the Change Order procedures described in Section 4.5 of the main text of the Agreement.
 
 	(d)	*
 
 	(e)	*
 
 	(f)	*
 
2.	Volume Forecasts. During the Steady State Period, Customer will provide Provider with rolling ninety (90) day volume forecasts at least sixty (60) days in advance of each month, starting with the first full month after the SS Commencement Date (the “Volume Forecasts”); provided, however, that the initial two (2) Volume Forecasts shall not be subject to the foregoing 60-day advance provision requirement. The Volume Forecasts shall be binding on Customer forty-five (45) days after Customer provides the Volume Forecast to Provider. Each Volume Forecast shall be signed by the Customer Account Manager and acknowledged in writing by the Provider Account Manager.
If the actual volume of transactions during a particular month does not deviate more than * from the binding Volume Forecast for that month (the “Acceptance Forecast Variance”), Customer will pay Provider for the actual volume of transactions processed during such month, subject to any applicable SLA Credits or SLA Bonuses. If the actual volume of transactions is less than the binding Volume Forecast for that month by more than *, then, in addition to paying for the actual volume of transactions, Customer shall pay Provider for the number of transactions that fall below the Acceptable Forecast Variance (the “Shortfall Transactions”) for that month such that, when such Shortfall Transactions are added to the actual volume for the month, the sum shall be equal to * of the applicable binding Volume Forecast. If the actual volume of transactions are greater than the Volume Forecast by more than *, Customer shall pay Provider for the actual volume processed, subject to any applicable SLA Credits or Bonuses, provided that Provider shall not be responsible for maintaining service levels agreed upon in the relevant SOW (or liable for SLA Credits thereon) for the volume of transactions that exceed the Acceptable Forecast Variance (the “Surplus Transactions”). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence relating to Surplus Transactions, to the extent applicable, a SOW may also specify the maximum volume of transactions that Provider can process in one day.
 
4
________________________________________
 	(a)	For example, if the binding Volume Forecast for the month of March is * transactions:
 
 	(i)	If the actual volume of transactions processed for March is * transactions, Customer shall pay Provider for such * transactions as well as an additional * transactions because such * transactions represent the number of Shortfall Transactions for such month.
 
 	(ii)	If the actual volume of transactions processed for March is * transactions, Customer shall pay Provider for * transactions and Provider will not be responsible for maintaining the service levels agreed upon in the relevant SOW (or liable for SLA Credits thereon) for * transactions because such * transactions represent the number of Surplus Transactions for such month.
 
 	(iii)	If the actual volume of transactions processed for March is * transactions, Customer shall pay Provider for * transactions because the actual volume is within the Acceptable Forecast Variance.
 
3.	Provider’s Responsibilities.
 
 	(a)	Provider’s responsibilities with respect to the Migration, as set forth in this Schedule, are referred to as the “Provider Migration Responsibilities.” Such Provider Migration Responsibilities include:
 
 	(i)	maintaining without unplanned disruption the Services and not otherwise unnecessarily disrupting Customer’s business operations;
 
 	(ii)	hiring and training Provider Personnel, preparing the appropriate number of physical seats with the necessary technology and bandwith on the communication links from India to the Provider’s point of presence in the United States and paying all costs associated therewith; and
 
 	(iii)	otherwise performing such migration tasks as are necessary to enable Provider to provide the Services, including following the Migration.
 
 	(b)	Provider will designate an individual who will be authorized to act as Customer’s primary contact with respect to the Migration (the “Provider Migration Manager”). Provider will not remove the individual serving as the Provider Migration Manager without Customer’s consent during such period of time from the Effective Date of the SOW through the completion of the Migration, unless any such individual (i) voluntarily leaves Provider; (ii) is removed because of performance reasons; (iii) has breached his or her employment agreement; or (iv) is physically unable to perform the tasks required (e.g., because of sickness or accident).
 
 	(c)	Except (i) as authorized by the JSC, or (ii) if necessary in the event of an emergency such that it would be impractical for Provider to consult with Customer (and solely for so long as the emergency continues), Provider shall
 
5
________________________________________
 	perform the Migration in accordance with the Migration Plan. Customer shall cooperate and provide reasonable assistance with respect to the Migration as specified in the Migration Plan or as otherwise requested reasonably in advance by Provider.
 
 	(d)	During the Migration, the Provider Migration Manager shall report weekly to Customer Migration Manager (as such term is defined below) regarding the status of the Migration.
 
 	(e)	If the Migration is not completed on or before the SS Commencement Date, then to the extent that such failure is due to the fault of Provider or its subcontractors or factors within their control, or due to causes beyond the reasonable control of Provider and Customer, Provider shall continue to take any and all actions, at Provider’s expense, necessary to cause the Services to be provided to Customer until such time as the incomplete portion of the Migration is complete and Provider is able to provide the Services to Customer. In addition, Customer shall have the right to terminate the SOW upon written notice to Provider without further liability to Provider thereunder.
However, if the Migration is not completed on or before the SS Commencement Date, then to the extent that such failure is due to the fault of Customer or other Service Recipients or factors within their control or due to causes beyond the reasonable control of Customer, upon Customer’s written request, Provider shall continue to take any and all actions, at Customer’s expense (at the applicable RU Rates), necessary to cause the Services to be provided to Customer until such time as the incomplete portion of the Migration is complete.
 
4.	Customer’s Responsibilities.
 
 	(a)	Customer’s responsibilities with respect to the Migration, as set forth in this Schedule, are referred to as the “Customer Migration Responsibilities.” Such Migration Responsibilities include:
 
 	(i)	establishing communications lines and network connections from Customer facilities to Provider’s point of presence (POP) in the United States, as required for Provider to access necessary Customer systems;
 
 	(ii)	otherwise performing such migration tasks as are necessary to enable Provider to provide the Services, including following the Migration.
 
 	(b)	Customer will designate an individual who will be authorized to act as Provider’s primary contact with respect to the Migration (the “Customer Migration Manager”).
 
5.	Schedule of Migration. It is anticipated that the Migration shall take place as a phased process with discrete groups of Services transferring to Provider at different times pursuant to an SOW for each such group (referred to herein as a “Wave”). The schedule for migration of Services as presently contemplated by the Parties is set forth below.

________________________________________
 	Either Party may decline to enter into or delay entering into a SOW for any Wave without penalty, other than as may be specifically provided in this Schedule. In addition, any description of the Services and the implementation dates described below are included for illustrative purposes only and will be superseded by the provisions of the applicable SOWs.

Schedule 5.4
Reports and Meetings
 
1.	Reports
 
 	1.1	As of the SOW Effective Date, Provider shall provide Customer the periodic reports set forth in subsection 1.2 of this Schedule 5.4, and within thirty (30) days after the SOW Effective Date, the Parties shall determine (as discussed below) additional periodic reports to be issued by Provider to Customer.

Performance Standards
 
1.	General
The Parties will establish specific quantitative performance standards (each, a “Performance Standard”) for certain of the Services (the “Service Levels”) in accordance with Section 7.1 of the main text of the Agreement. After the relevant SS Commencement Date, Provider’s level of performance shall at all times be at least equal to the Service Levels set forth in the applicable SOW.
 
2.	General Standards Regarding Availability of Services
Unless otherwise provided in a SOW,
 
 	(a)	Normal Working Days. Provider will provide the Services during U.S. Business Hours; provided, however, that with Customer’s prior written approval, certain Services may be performed after or before U.S. Business Hours.
 
 	(b)	Availability Standard. Provider will ensure that the Services, Equipment and Software are current and available during Scheduled Hours of Availability at least * of the time in any given month.
 
3.	Service Levels; SLA Credits and Bonuses
The Performance Standards and Service Levels applicable to the Services shall be developed during the Planning and Ramp Up Periods pursuant to Schedule 4.2 and set forth in the relevant SOWs.
 
 	(a)	Acceptable Variance. Each SOW shall define what constitutes an acceptable variance from the baseline Service Level. So long as Provider’s performance falls within the acceptable variance, no Service Failure or Service Excellence shall be deemed to have occurred and, consequently, no SLA Credits or SLA Bonuses shall apply.
 
 	(b)	Service Failures. Each SOW shall define what constitutes a Minor Service Failure, a Major Service Failure and a Catastrophic Service Failure under the SOW and the thresholds for each. Upon the occurrence of any such Service Failure, Provider will be assessed SLA Credits in the amounts and according to the formulas set forth in the SOW.
 
 	(c)	Service Excellence. Each SOW shall define what shall constitute a Minor Service Excellence and a Major Service Excellence. Upon Provider’s achievement of a Service Excellence, Provider will be assessed SLA Bonuses in the amounts and according to the formulas set forth in the SOW.
 
1
________________________________________
 	(d)	Service Failure and Service Excellence Thresholds. The Service Failure and Service Excellence thresholds in each SOW will be mirrored. For example suppose the baseline SLA is * accuracy and the acceptable variance is * (* to * accuracy). If the Service Excellence and Service Failure level 1 threshold is, say, * then the Service Excellence level 1 would be * and the Service Failure level 1 would be *. If the Service Excellence and Service Failure level 2 threshold is, say, *, then the Service Excellence level 2 would be * and the Service Failure level 2 would be *. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties will determine jointly the Catastrophic Service Failure threshold, which threshold will not be mirrored by a corresponding Service Excellence threshold.
 
 	(e)	SLA Credits and SLA Bonuses. Each SOW shall assign the amount of SLA Credits payable by Provider to Customer for each Service Failure level and the amount of SLA Bonuses payable by Customer to Provider for each Service Excellence level, provided that within any mirrored level, the amount of the SLA Credits shall be at least twice the amount of the SLA Bonuses for the given Service.
 
 	(f)	SLA Credit and SLA Bonus Cap. Each SOW may specify the maximum amount of SLA Credits payable by Provider to Customer (a “SLA Credits Cap”) and SLA Bonuses payable by Customer to Provider (a “SLA Bonuses Cap”) in a given month, provided that in any event the SLA Credits Cap shall be at least twice the amount of any SLA Bonuses Cap for the given Service. Unless otherwise specified in a SOW or adjusted pursuant to subsection (g) below, the SLA Credits Cap shall not exceed * of the monthly invoice for such Service during the first year following the Effective Date of the Agreement and * of the monthly invoice for such Service after the first anniversary of such Effective Date and the SLA Bonuses Cap shall not exceed * of the monthly invoice for such Service during the first year following the Effective Date of the Agreement and * of the monthly invoice for such Service after the first anniversary of such Effective Date.
 
 	(g)	Annual Review. The JSC shall review the Performance Standards and the Service Levels, including the Service Failure and Service Excellence thresholds, the SLA Credit and SLA Bonus amounts applicable at each threshold and the SLA Credits Cap and SLA Bonuses Cap, for all of the Services on an annual basis in light of Provider’s performance over the preceding year and to reflect improved performance capabilities associated with advances in the technology and methods used to perform the Services. The Parties shall then make such adjustments in the relevant SOWS as they deem appropriate in their reasonable discretion. The Parties expect and understand that the Service Levels will improve over time.
 
 	(h)	Steady State. Unless otherwise specified in the relevant SOW, no Performance Standards or SLA Bonuses or Credits will apply until the Steady State Period.
 
 	(i)	Relief Event. Upon the occurrence of a Relief Event, no SLA Credits will be assessed in connection with Provider’s provision of the affected Service.

________________________________________
4.	Failure to Perform
 
 	(a)	In the event Provider fails to meet a Performance Standard, Provider shall (i) investigate, assemble and preserve pertinent information with respect to, and report on the causes of, the problem, including performing a root cause analysis of the problem; (ii) advise Customer, as and to the extent requested by Customer, of the status of remedial efforts being undertaken with respect to such problem; (iii) minimize the impact of the problem, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the problem, and begin meeting the Performance Standard (if impacted); and (iv) take appropriate preventive measures so that the problem does not recur. As part of such efforts, Provider Personnel shall work in collaboration with Customer to identify the offending system(s), procedures or Personnel contributing to such Service Failures.
 
 	(b)	In the event that any Provider Service Failure under the Agreement results in Customer being assessed any type of monetary fine or penalty, then Provider shall be responsible for the full amount of such fine or penalty in accordance with the indemnification provisions contained in Section 18 of the main text of the Agreement.
 
5.	Measurement and Monitoring Tools
Initially, Provider shall have access to and use measurement and monitoring tools as utilized and implemented by Customer immediately prior to the Effective Date. Provider shall implement and utilize the necessary measurement and monitoring tools and procedures required to measure and report Provider’s performance of the Services against the Service Levels. To the extent the measurement and monitoring tools and procedures are not specified in a SOW, Customer shall have the right to approve such measurement and monitoring tools and procedures prior to their implementation by Provider. Such measurement and monitoring shall permit reporting at a level of detail sufficient to verify compliance with the Service Levels, and shall be subject to audit by Customer. Provider shall provide Customer with information and access to such tools and procedures upon request, for purposes of verification.
 
6.	Customer Survey
Provider and Customer shall conduct a survey, at Customer’s cost, each year of (i) Customer’s customers and (ii) internal Customer users, which survey is designed to determine the level of satisfaction with the Services performed by Provider. Provider and Customer will mutually agree on the form and content of the surveys, which shall include representative samples of each major category of customer of, or user within, Customer and an agreed upon number of in-depth face-to-face or telephone interviews.

In the event that Customer determines in good faith that the continued assignment to Customer’s account of one of the Key Provider Personnel is not in the best interests of Customer, then Customer shall give Provider written notice to that effect. After receipt of such notice, Provider shall have a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days, in which to investigate the matters stated in such notice, discuss its findings with Customer and resolve the problems with such person. If, following such period (not to exceed ten (10) Business Days), Customer requests replacement of such person, Provider shall replace that person with another person of suitable ability and qualifications. However, where Customer notifies Provider that Customer has determined that the nature of the concern is of such a nature that such Key Provider Personnel should be removed immediately (albeit temporarily) from Customer’s account, Provider shall immediately remove such individual(s) from Customer’s account, provided that any such Customer request for immediate removal of Key Provider Personnel (i) may not be arbitrary, and/or (ii) may not be unlawful (e.g., removal because of employee’s age). In any event, any request by Customer to remove an individual from Customer’s account shall not be deemed to constitute a termination of such individual’s employment by Provider and in no event shall Customer be deemed an employer of any such person.
 
 	(b)	In the event Customer requests Provider to provide new Services, as provided in Section 2.2.1 of the main text of the Agreement, Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such new Services utilizing Key Provider Personnel who are familiar with the Customer account and Customer’s business.
 
2.	Compliance with Customer Policies
 
 	(a)	While at Customer’s premises (or the premises of others receiving the Services hereunder), Provider Personnel shall (i) comply with Customer’s requests, rules, and regulations regarding personal and professional conduct (including the wearing of an identification badge and adhering to regulations and general safety, dress, behavior, and security practices or procedures) generally applicable to such premises and communicated to the Provider Account Manager or a Provider-designated location senior Provider manager, and (ii) otherwise conduct themselves in a businesslike and professional manner. If requested by Customer, Provider shall have all Provider Personnel engaged in providing Services to Customer execute acknowledgement of Customer’s conduct and other policies

 	and Provider shall maintain records of compliance therewith which shall be made available to Customer upon request.
 
 	(b)	Provider shall ensure that all Provider Personnel comply during the Term with: (a) the Administrative Manuals, as may be amended from time to time by the JSC, and/or policies otherwise made known by Customer to Provider from time to time, except to the extent the same are clearly not applicable or where Provider has substantially equivalent policies, (b) such aspects of the Customer Corporate Compliance Program as may be required by Customer and on which Customer has provided training, and (c) all rules of behavior, work schedules, security procedures and other standards, policies and procedures as established by or maintained by Customer from time to time and communicated to the Provider Account Manager. To the extent the foregoing policies and procedures change during the Term, Customer shall inform the Provider Account Manager in writing. If such changes cause Provider to incur a Significant Cost Increase, Provider shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment.
 
3.	Training of Provider Personnel
 
 	(a)	All Provider Personnel shall be required to be certified as having, at a minimum, the following training and certifications (or the portions thereof deemed by the JSC to be applicable to the SOW(s) with respect to which such Provider Personnel are providing services): HIPAA training; Red Flags training; fraud and abuse training, and applicable Revenue Management Certifications, provided that Customer has made such training and certification materials available to Provider. Provider shall be responsible for providing all such training and certifications in form and substance as prescribed by Customer. While Provider Personnel need not have substantive knowledge or experience in healthcare, billing or collections, all Provider Personnel shall possess the prerequisite skills and qualifications appropriate for the nature and complexity of the tasks and Services he or she will be required to perform and have undergone the training and certifications required by Customer.
 
 	(b)	The Parties acknowledge that if Provider fails to meet Service Levels during the Term, and such failures are caused by the fact that Provider’s Personnel are inadequately trained, then Customer shall have the right to require Provider to implement solutions, as reasonably suggested by Customer, at Provider’s cost, in order to address such personnel issues leading to the failures. However, in the event that Provider Personnel have been trained in accordance with the training materials provided by Customer and Provider Personnel have completed certification/accreditation in accordance with Customer’s standards, Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any such Customer-required additional training.
 
4.	In addition, Provider shall ensure that all Provider Personnel performing the Services shall meet the specific requirements, if any, defined in each SOW.

Schedule 12.2
Facilities
 
1.	Facilities Generally.
 
 	(a)	Provider shall perform all Services using dedicated, secure facilities. Provider shall perform the Services in two separate facilities. To the extent either facility is not entirely dedicated to the provision of the Services to Customer, Provider shall create and utilize a segregated portion of the facility to perform the Services so that the Services are not performed in areas within the facility in which Provider is performing services for any other customer unless on a temporary basis and Provider has received Customer’s prior written consent. Provider shall perform the Services for Customer at the location(s) provided under the SOWS (the “Provider Facilities”).
 
 	(b)	Any Provider-proposed relocation of the facilities from which any of the Services are provided is subject to the following:
 
 	(i)	no less than one hundred and eighty (180) days before the proposed relocation, Provider shall provide notice of the proposed relocation and an analysis of the proposed impact to Customer;
 
 	(ii)	Provider shall develop a migration plan reasonably acceptable to Customer which is designed to minimize disruptions or degradation in Service to Customer during the migration period;
 
 	(iii)	any relocation is subject to Customer’s prior written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Provider acknowledges that Customer’s reasonable concerns with respect to the security, staffing, physical capabilities, and related factors of the new facility shall be a sufficient basis for Customer to withhold approval of such relocation;
 
 	(iv)	Provider shall assume financial responsibility for any of its transition costs, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties;
 
2.	Provider Facilities.
Provider shall be responsible for providing the Provider Facilities from which Provider shall provide all Services. In addition to being segregated, the space in the facilities from which Services will be provided for Customer shall be contiguous, unless otherwise agreed to in advance by the Parties or as otherwise approved by Customer. Each facility shall comply with all applicable laws, including but not limited to local health and safety standards, and be at least comparable to other facilities of similar services providers in the same country that house well-managed back-office transactions processing and customer contact operations performing services similar to the Services. Provider shall provide the facilities in time so that the Services may be transitioned to the Provider Facilities in accordance with the Pre-Services Migration Plan, as provided in Schedule
 
1
________________________________________
4.2. Provider shall provide space in each facility, at no charge to Customer, for Customer employees and consultants, as requested by Customer and the requirements shall be set forth in the applicable SOW or during the Controlled Migration Period as contemplated in Section 22.3 of the main text of the Agreement. This includes heat, light, power, air conditioning, uninterruptible power supply (if any), and other similar utilities, office space, furniture, secure storage space and equipment staging facilities, telephone service in support of the Services, office support services (including security and janitorial), and coordination of facility access security requirements to be used by Provider in support of the Services.

3.	Customer Obligations.
 
 	(a)	All Customer Data shall be maintained on servers located in the United States (the “Customer Facilities”).
 
 	(b)	To the extent relevant to Provider performing its obligations under the Agreement or any SOW, Customer will inform Provider of any plans or determination to relocate the Customer Facilities so that Provider will have a reasonable amount of time to prepare for and implement such change or relocation as it impacts Provider.
 
4.	Provider Obligations.
 
 	(a)	Provider shall use the Customer Facilities for the sole and exclusive purposes of providing the Services under the Agreement. The use of Customer Facilities by Provider does not constitute a leasehold or other property interest in favor of Provider.
 
 	(b)	Provider shall use the Customer Facilities in a manner that is coordinated, and does not interfere, with Customer’s business operations. To the extent that Provider operates the space in a manner that materially and unnecessarily increases facility or other costs incurred by Customer, Customer shall notify Provider of such costs and Provider shall take such steps as may be necessary to reduce such facility costs to a level reasonably acceptable to Customer. Provider shall be responsible for any damage to the Customer Facilities resulting from the abuse, misuse, or negligence of Provider or other failure to comply with its obligations respecting the Customer Facilities, and Customer shall have the right to set off the reasonable and actual cost of repairing any such damage against charges payable to Provider under the Agreement.

 	(b)	A benchmarking study may be conducted by Customer utilizing its own forces or such consultants as Customer may deem appropriate, and Customer may request an adjustment to the compensation Provider receives hereunder on the basis thereof. If Provider agrees to such rate adjustment, then the Agreement and any applicable SOWs shall be amended accordingly. If Provider does not agree to Customer’s request, Customer may cause the study to be conducted by an independent, third party, industry-recognized benchmarking service provider designated by Customer (the “Third Party Benchmarker”). The Parties shall cooperate with the Third Party Benchmarker, including, as appropriate, making available knowledgeable personnel and pertinent documents and records. The Third Party Benchmarker shall execute a confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth in Section 14 of the main text of the Agreement, unless there already exists a confidentiality agreement with the Third Party Benchmarker. All internal and third party costs incurred by Customer in performing, or having a Third Party Benchmarker perform, the benchmarking study shall be borne by Customer.
 
 	(c)	The Third Party Benchmarker shall perform the benchmarking in accordance with the Third Party Benchmarker’s documented procedures, which procedures shall be provided to the Parties prior to the start of the benchmarking process and to which the Parties may comment prior to the benchmarking.

The Third Party Benchmarker shall select the representative sample from entities (i) identified by
 
3
________________________________________
 	the Third Party Benchmarker, and (ii) identified by a Party and approved by the Third Party Benchmarker. The following conditions apply to the representative sample: (A) it shall include at least four (4) entities and no more than twelve (12) entities, and (B) it may include entities that are outsourcing customers of Provider in related fields or similar types of transactions.
 
 	(d)	The Third Party Benchmarker is to conduct a benchmarking as promptly as is prudent in the circumstances. In conducting the benchmarking, the Third Party Benchmarker shall normalize the data used to perform the benchmarking to accommodate, as appropriate, differences in volume of services, scope of services, service levels, financing or payment streams, and other pertinent factors. Each Party shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review, comment on and request changes in the Third Party Benchmarker’s proposed findings. Following such review and comment, the Third Party Benchmarker shall issue a final report of its findings and conclusions.
 
 	(e)	If in the final report of the Third Party Benchmarker, the SS Rates and/or performance to Customer under the Agreement for the benchmarked Services are not in the * of the representative sample (viewed from the perspective of Customer) (e.g., lower than * of the representative sample with respect to the SS Rates) (“*”), then the following shall apply:
 
 	(i)	After collaboration with and discussion between the Parties with respect to the Third Party Benchmarker’s final report (which the Parties shall examine reasonably and in good faith), Provider shall give Customer written notification within * after issuance of the Third Party Benchmarker’s final report whether Provider accepts such final report. If Provider accepts such report, Provider promptly shall develop a plan and schedule, subject to the approval of Customer, to bring Provider within the * (or such other percentage as agreed by the Parties) in a reasonable period of time, but in any event no longer than within * (unless otherwise agreed by the Parties). Provider then shall implement the plan.
 
 	(ii)	If (A) Provider does not provide notice that Provider accepts the Third Party Benchmarker’s final report within *, as provided above, or (B) the Parties are unable to agree on an appropriate plan and schedule to respond to the Third Party Benchmarker’s final report, as provided above, then the Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute in accordance with Section 24 of the main text of the Agreement, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Provider’s failure to accept the Third Party Benchmarker’s final report shall not constitute a breach by Provider of the Agreement.
 
 	(iii)	If in the final report of the Third Party Benchmarker, the SS Rates to Customer under the Agreement for the benchmarked Services are in the * of the representative sample (viewed from the perspective of most
